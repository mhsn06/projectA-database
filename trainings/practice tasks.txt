Practice requirement:
We want to store student's data of any institution and find information about student's progress


Practice Solution:
----------------------
We have two task here.
(a) Design a database for storing student's information.
(b) Defining the queries to implement in a database system.


Solution:
Identifying entities and attributes:
-----------------------------------------
    Students (Name, Address, Phone No, Student Id, Session, Registration No)
    Course (Course Name, Credit)
    Result (first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight)
    Department(Name, Building, Floor)
Identifying relations:
------------------------------------------
    1. One student may take multiple Course and A course can be taken by multiple student. Hence Students and Courses has many to many relation.
    2. One student has only one result. Hence one to one relation.
    3. A student belongs to only one department but department has many students. Hence one to many relation.
    
    Now draw the appropriate diagram.
    
    Put the file in the database repository.
