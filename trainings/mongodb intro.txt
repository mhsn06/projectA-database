This document describe mongodb basic concepts and necessary tools to work.

First section describes basic of mongodb.
Second section provides instruction to connect and perform query to the actual database system.


-------------------- MongoDB basics ------------------------------

Documents
A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.

Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/

Collections
MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables.

Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/

Databases
In MongoDB, databases hold collections of documents.

Example
--------------------------------
Description:
Design a database to store students academic data and personal data in two different collection and build relation between them.
Query: Show all data for a student.


Soltion References:


We store the relevent data in two different collection.


We link both the collections by using Database References
Get the short theory of database references using following link
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/database-references/#manual-references


Then we query to get joined data from both collection.
Theory and hands on are available on the following link
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#lookup-single-equality




Hw2 implementation example:




// this line generate a key to build relation
relation_ref = ObjectId()




// the following code insert academic information
db.students_academy.insert({
        "_id": relation_ref,
        "result": "A+",
        "fees" : "paid",
        "info_1": "bla bla bla"
})


// the following code insert personal info for the above record


db.students_personal.insert({
        "roll": relation_ref,
        "name" : "AB",
        "father": "MR. A",
        "mother": "MR. B"
})


//the following code query to find all information by a query
db.students_personal.aggregate({
 $lookup:{
        from: "students_academy",
        localField: "roll",
        foreignField: "_id",
        as : "academic_information"
        }
})


//output should be like below:
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5c21afcbb22ec61c09badb36"), "roll" : ObjectId("5c21afc9b22ec61c09badb35"), "name" : "AB", "father" : "MR. A", "mother" : "MR. B", "academic_information" : [ { "_id" : ObjectId("5c21afc9b22ec61c09badb35"), "result" : "A+", "fees" : "paid", "info_1" : "bla bla bla" } ] }




--------------- Query to Remote MongoDB Database System -------------------

step - 1: Download and Extract Mongo Shell
---------------------------------------------------
https://downloads.mongodb.org/win32/mongodb-shell-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-4.0.5.zip

1. Go to the download folder where the mongo shell downloaded.
2. Extract the file
3. Copy the extracted folder inside C drive

step - 2: Configure and test the mongo shell
--------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to open the mongo shell.
The following instructions are for windows only.
1. Go inside the bin folder inside the mongo shell folder in the C drive.
3. Copy the location path of the folder
4. Right click on the my computer and select "properties"
5. Click on the "advanced system settings"
6. Click on "environment vairable"
7. You will see two section. Scroll the lower section and find "path" under "variable" column.
8. Select "path" and click edit.
9. Paste the copied mongo shell location at the end of the path.
10. Click save. Click ok for the rest of the dialogue.
11. Right click on the desktop and open git bash
12. Type "mongo --version" and press enter. It should output something like following.
13. If you see any missing error, download & install the following program.

--------- Console Output ----------
MongoDB shell version v4.0.5
git version: 3739429dd92b92d1b0ab120911a23d50bf03c412
allocator: tcmalloc
modules: none
build environment:
    distmod: 2008plus-ssl
    distarch: x86_64
    target_arch: x86_64
--------------

step - 3: Connect to remote mongo database system.
--------------------------------------------------
Before performing this step contact with me and get your username and password.

After getting your username and password type the following in mongo shell. Put your username in the the place of dash and press enter

mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-t3qae.mongodb.net/test" --username _________

If all goes well you should see be able to perform queries.
